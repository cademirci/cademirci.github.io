# Personal Website

My name is Çağlayan Demirci and this is my personal website which is including software I made, information about me and some of my blog posts.

I designed and coded new version of my website, which is powered by Jekyll. I used no bootstrap, Jekyll-theme or any ready-to-use template.
Wrote CSS and JavaScript a lot.

Ignore the absurd number of commits, this repository's purpose is not only a software working space but also a living website. While I am updating the website, I push my changes without so much care.
