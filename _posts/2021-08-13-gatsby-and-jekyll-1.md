<p class="image-description">Static site generator (SSG) frameworks.</p>

I have written the website you are currently reading on nearly 3-4 years ago. At the moment, I designed and coded some pages with Jekyll and changed for absurdly many times. I used to name these versions of my personal webpage project after Greek alphabet, when I was lastly counting I guess it was version Epsilon (5) or Zeta (6) or something, not sure. Anyways :)

At the times, I was a computer science student who were constucting Java data structures all the time, out of school times learning and coding to be a fullstack dev (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), and constantly thinking about it would be very nice if I learn JavaScript frameworks like Node, React and Angular (Vue wasn't popular back then). But never did it. If I did, this webpage would surely be written in Gatsby which is the little brother of React. I don't regret it though, I learned a great deal while I was working on Jekyll but as I said I will definitely use Gatsby next time I need to use a SSG.

I don't want to migrate my webpage from Jekyll to Gatsby, I know there are ways of it, but it would be a waste of time. First of all, cademirci.com is a CSS website before it is a complete frontend framework's one. I have spent a lot of time for its looking in order for it to be stylish, original and professional at the same time. I painted and drew Adobe Illustrator files, I mixed colors for thousands of times, I changed fonts, margins and everything. The result still doesn't satisfy me :) But okay. Anyway, it hasn't an impressingly complex technical infrastructure and it doesn't have to be another framework's system at the moment. From now on, I will be publishing posts and drawing somethings again in order to try to catch the perfect (I know I won't be able to do it but again, it's ok).

There are several pages as blog posts, documentations etc that you can find on the web about comparing static website generators. Especially because of Gatsby and Jekyll are the most popular ones of them, there will be many like my one. Therefore, I decided to try to write something very specific about Gatsby and Jekyll. This articles will be kind of personal views about them and I hope it will be helpful for you.
