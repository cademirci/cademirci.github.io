<p class="image-description">Static site generator (SSG frameworks.</p>

I wrote, the website you are currently reading on, nearly 3-4 years ago. At the moment, I designed and coded some pages with Jekyll and changed for absurdly many times. I used to name them as my personal webpage project versions Greek alphabet. When I was lastly counting I guess it was Epsilon (5) or something, not sure. I say it because as I remember this page is *personalWebpage ver Zeta*. Anyways :)

At the times, I was a computer science student who were constucting Java data structures all the time, learning and coding to be a fullstack dev (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) outside school times, and constantly thinking about it would be very nice if I learn JavaScript frameworks like Node, React and Angular (Vue wasn't popular back then). But never did it. If I did it, this webpage would surely be written in Gatsby. I don't regret it though, I learned a great deal while I was working on Jekyll but as I said I will definitely use Gatsby next time I need to use a SSG (Static Site Generator).

I don't want to migrate my webpage from Jekyll to Gatsby, I know there are ways of it, but it would be a waste of time. First of all, cademirci.com is a CSS website before it is a backend language one. I have spent a lot of time for its looking in order for it to be stylish, original and professional at the same time. I painted and drawed Adobe Illustrator files, I mixed colors for thousands of times, I changed fonts, margins and everything. The result still doesn't satisfy me :) But okay. Anyway, it hasn't an impressingly complex technical infrastructure and it doesn't have to be another framework's system at the moment. From now on, I will be publishing posts and drawing somethings again in order to try to catch the perfect but I know I won't be able :) but again, it's ok.

There are several pages that you can find on the web about comparing static website generators. Especially because of Gatsby and Jekyll are the most popular ones of them, there are many like this one. By the way people often adds Hugo to this two things, but I have no idea about it, for my part. So, I decided to write something very specific down about Gatsby and Jekyll. This article will be kind of personal views about them and I hope it will be helpful for you, too.
