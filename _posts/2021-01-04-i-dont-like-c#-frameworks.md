Actually I don't claim anything like a 20-year experienced architect, and I don't say working with those are wrong. I just feel that C# is not my cup of tea.

As a second "actually", I don't like Windows in the first place and may be I have a started with a prejudice for other Microsoft products. Also may be I can say only *most of the* C# frameworks are not good.

### C#

I learned computer programming with Java. I wrote data structures, projects on it. Therefore I am familiar with C#, but here is the problem: I don'use Java anymore when I'm free, I prefer languages like JavaScript, Python etc. Because *signal to noise ratio* of Java is low. That means when you intend to do something, the number of characters you type is too high comparaed to JS or Python. So is C#.

Also I have always think that C family languages (C, C++ and C#) has alternatives in order to modern and joyful projects. May be unless you are not an electronics engineer ot game developer, I don't know.

### ASP and ASP.NET

First of all I think ASP is not suitable for use anymore. As a structure, not a modern tool at all. It is not updated for decades. 

ASP.NET is not simple to learn and use. It has many spesific techniques for itself. Expending the project is hard and it is tedious. Returning from a mistake is a trouble.

### ASP.NET MVC 

If I must use a C# framework to do web apps, I would pick this up. It is much more clear and understandable for a person who works on any web framework. It has clearly seperated `models`, `views` and `controllers` and once if you understand the goals of this architecture, making progress is easier.

Nevertheless if I am responsable for a project and free to do, I prefer NodeJS for ten times (and Django for a couple of times) over ASP.NET MVC.

Additionally, I be bored when I see Windows forced a user to do use some tool. Even if there are Linux and MacOS alternatives to implement C# projects, it is quiet clear that the best environments for it are using Visual Studio IDE on Windows operating system. I have an annoying experience about it.
