Actually, don't worry if you are a C# lover :) I don't claim anything like a 20-year experienced architect, and I don't say working with those are wrong. I just feel that C# is not my cup of tea.

As a second "actually", I don't like Windows in the first place and may be I have a started with a prejudice for other Microsoft products. Also may be I can say only *most of the* C# frameworks are not good.

### C#

I learned computer programming with Java. I wrote data structures, projects on it. Therefore I am familiar with C#, but here is the problem: I don'use Java anymore when I'm free, I prefer languages like JavaScript, Python etc. Because *signal to noise ratio* of Java is low. That means when you implement some code, ratio of the output of the porgram to the number of characters you type is too low, compared to JS or Python. So is C#'s one.

Also I have always think that C family languages (C, C++ and C#) has alternatives in order to do modern and joyful projects. May be unless you are not an electronics engineer ot game developer, I don't know.

### ASP and ASP.NET

First of all I think ASP is not suitable to use anymore. As a structure, not a modern tool at all. Plus it is not updated for decades. 

ASP.NET is not simple to learn and use. It has many spesific techniques for itself. Expending the project is hard and it is tedious. Returning from a mistake is a trouble.

### ASP.NET MVC 

If I must use a C# framework to do web apps, I prefer to pick this up. It is much more clear and understandable for a person who works on any web framework. It has clearly seperated `models`, `views` and `controllers` and once if you understand the goals of this architecture, making progress is easier. In this way, it seems like the other good frameworks of web development.

Nevertheless if I am responsable for a project and free to do, I prefer NodeJS for ten times (and Django for a couple of times) over ASP.NET MVC. (Only for now of course, I do not know what will I think after a few more years of coding)

Additionally, I be bored when I see Windows forced a user to do use some tool. Even if there are Linux and MacOS alternatives to implement C# projects, it is quiet clear that the best environment for it is Visual Studio IDE on Windows operating system. I have an annoying experience about it.
