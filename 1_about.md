`hello world.`

As a regular computer science student at university, I work on general programming, hardware and math. Meanwhile, the fields that I am the most enthusiastic about are web technologies and designing. Currently I focus on Javascript frameworks like Node, Vue and Electron.

In my personal life, I love to read and watch fantasy arts, listen to heavy metal and drink coffee a lot. I like trekking, love to walking in the woods. Interested in mythology and cultures, languages and etymology.
