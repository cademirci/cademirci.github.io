    This application allows you to mark with a pin somewhere you have been on an open world map; put a photo and a text related with there and the memory.

    It can be thought as some kind of very simple Foursquare clone. Only been-and-mark is written for personal usage, like a blog or a diary let's say. I have written a web application with an interactive map in my internship; then I wanted to rewrite and put a simpler and joyful version of it into Github, as a self development. Plus this is a totally different idea actually.

Using Liquid in Javascript, Jekyll does not allow you to use `{{ project.content }}`. At least I couldn't find the way.
I use a frontmatter element `description` instead. Now `{{ project.description }}` prints the block above in `main.js`.

I'm sad, Markdown would be so simple instead of all stupid HTML tags.
