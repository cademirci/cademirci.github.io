    <h4>Java</h4>
    I worked Java throughout my computer science education, I did many assignments with it that not so
    worthy to put them into GitHub. The only instance is that the last data structure assignment was
    an introduction to image processing, by implementing and using "quadtree" tree structure.
    It can be viewed &rarr; <a href="https://github.com/cademirci/quadtree-ppm-java">on GitHub</a>.
    <h4>Python</h4>
    Generally I use this to write useful little tools for myself, instead of Java. I wrote for example,
    programs that automates my works on my Linux computer, directory or file readers, etc.
    Additionally I have written a website back-end as a job, by using Django which is also a
    Python framework.

    I do not count any language or framework that I have taken as a lecture once, or
    tried for a couple of days. Like C language or something. Also I would say this in the first
    place, these sections are not a claim that I am pro on any of these, of course. I wrote these as
    like a conversation.

Using Liquid in JavaScript, Jekyll does not allow you to use `{{ project.content }}`. At least I couldn't find the way.
I use a frontmatter element `description` instead. Now `{{ project.description }}` prints the block above in `main.js`.

I'm sad, Markdown would be so simple instead of all stupid HTML tags.
