    While I was preparing this website first, I used to manage almost entire site with jQuery.
    Because I like to write JS and I thought jQuery was very popular and as better way to use
    javascript as ten years ago. However, jQuery is an outdated library and it is odd to exist on a modern website now. Since
    then I have removed all jQuery files in my working space and changed my mindset into create
    animations with CSS transitions. I went my way on with to write only native JavaScript also.
name: jQuery

Using Liquid in JavaScript, Jekyll does not allow you to use `{{ project.content }}`. At least I couldn't find the way.
I use a frontmatter element `description` instead. Now `{{ project.description }}` prints the block above in `main.js`.

I'm sad, Markdown would be so simple instead of all stupid HTML tags.
