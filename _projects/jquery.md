    While I was preparing this website first, I used to manage almost entire site with jquery.
    Because I like to write JS and I thought jquery was very popular and as better way to use
    javascript as ten years ago. Indeed, jquery syntax is fun and short, and some of its functions
    -f.i. animate- seem like the best and easiest way to do something on a page.
    <br><br>
    However, jquery is an outdated library and it is odd to exist on a modern website now. Since
    then I have removed all jquery files in my working space and changed my mindset into create
    animations with CSS transitions. I went my way on with to write only native javascript also.
    <br><br>
    I used to write some jquery codes for some insignificant websites in the past. Now I can say
    that, if this library is necessary somewhere, or any supervisor wants me to write this, I am
    able to do it. On the other hand I do not prefer to do.
