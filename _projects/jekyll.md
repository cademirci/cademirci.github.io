    Jekyll framework of Ruby is a tool that provides you to build static web pages.
    I have built the current version of my personal website, which is you are reading
    on at the moment, is powered by Jekyll. Used no bootstrap, theme or ready-to-use template.
    I wanted my personal website to be my design up to every single pixel. Just Jekyll
    structure with html, css and native Javascript. It was extremely fun.
    <br><br>
    I like Jekyll and it is familiar to me but if I build another static site for myself,
    I mean the next version, probably I will use Nuxt.js of Vue. It does worth to learn to
    go forward.
    <br><br>
    I also coded a little code block regulator for Jekyll pages called "ghost-code.js",
    which can be viewed &rarr; <a href="https://github.com/cademirci/ghost-code">on Github</a>.

Using Liquid in Javascript, Jekyll does not allow you to use `{{ project.content }}`. At least I couldn't find the way.
I use a frontmatter element `description` instead. Now `{{ project.description }}` prints the block above in `main.js`.
