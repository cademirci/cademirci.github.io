    My current personal website is powered by Jekyll static site generator framework. Used no bootstrap, theme or ready-to-use template.
    I wanted my personal website to be my design up to every single pixel. Only Jekyll
    structure with HTML, CSS and native JavaScript. It was extremely fun.
    <br><br>
    I also coded a little code block regulator for Jekyll pages called "ghost-code.js",
    which can be viewed &rarr; <a href="https://github.com/cademirci/ghost-code">on Github</a>.

Using Liquid in JavaScript, Jekyll does not allow you to use `{{ project.content }}`. At least I couldn't find the way.
I use a frontmatter element `description` instead. Now `{{ project.description }}` prints the block above in `main.js`.

I'm sad, Markdown would be so simple instead of all stupid HTML tags.
