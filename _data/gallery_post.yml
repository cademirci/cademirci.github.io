- name: "Valhalla Logo"
  excerpt: I have designed this logo for my radio show, it was a rock music program. The grey man is not Gandalf (most of the people think that),
           but exactly the inspiration of Gandalf; he is Odin. The bird is a raven, it is either Huginn or Muninn. Besides I used three 
           snowflake/hexagons within the 'A' letters. They stand for north and winter culture, those things I love :)

- name: "Frozen Finance"
  excerpt: I took this photo when I took a walk on a snowy day. On the background the finance center / urban area of my city in the snow fog, barely seen.
           This photo was taken in the pandemic times.

- name: "Workspace"
  excerpt: A digital painting I made for my website <a href="">(home page)</a>. May be I could draw the coffe cup a little bigger. 
           Besides I have drawn the linear graphic waves manually, therefore they aren't sharp enough. Plus, the beaker would be prettier 
           and code lines a bit longer. Gradient from blue-gray to purple-gray stands for "serious business".

- name: "A Blog Page"
  excerpt: Ditto for the site <a href="">(blog page)</a>. This is one of my favourites, because it is simple and cute. Especially I like my 
           ink bottle and the feather pen. Graphics and papers additionally, are representing a blog post in a cute and freestyle way. 
           Gradient from brown to gray stands for library-style archiving.
