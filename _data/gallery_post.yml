- name: "Shaman is Coming"
  excerpt: I am learning Adobe Illustrator. I am regretful that I have not begin it before. This is my first drawing with it, since shaman is a very
           important fantasy image for me and also one of my niknames.

- name: "Valhalla Logo"
  excerpt: I have designed this logo for my radio show, it was a rock music program. The grey man is not Gandalf (most of the people think that),
           but exactly the inspiration of Gandalf; he is Odin. The bird is a raven, it is either Huginn or Muninn. Besides I used three 
           snowflake/hexagons within the 'A' letters. They stand for north and winter culture, those things I love :)

- name: Screenshots from Valheim
  excerpt: Since "I like to design and build things" is the header catchphrase of my page, I fell in love with one of the most beautiful games of last 
           years; Valheim. I am putting some screenshots from that game; some houses, rooms and strongholds I've built with my character.

- name: "Workspace"
  excerpt: A digital painting I made for my website <a href="">(home page)</a>. May be I could draw the coffe cup a little bigger. 
           Besides I have drawn the linear graphic waves manually, therefore they aren't sharp enough. Plus, the beaker would be prettier 
           and code lines a bit longer. Gradient from blue-gray to purple-gray stands for "serious business".

- name: "A Blog Page"
  excerpt: Ditto for the site <a href="">(blog page)</a>. This is one of my favourites, because it is simple and cute. Especially I like my 
           ink bottle and the feather pen. Graphics and papers additionally, are representing a blog post in a cute and freestyle way. 
           Gradient from brown to gray stands for library-style archiving.
