I have built the current version of my personal website, which is you are reading on at the moment, is powered by Jekyll. Used no bootstrap, theme or ready-to-use template. I wanted my personal website to be my design up to every single pixel. Just Jekyll structure with html, css and native Javascript. It was extremely fun. <br><br> I like Jekyll and it is familiar to me but if I build another static site for myself, I mean the next version, probably I will use Nuxt.js of Vue. It does worth to learn to go forward. <br><br> I also coded a little code block regulator for Jekyll pages called "ghost-code.js", which can be viewed &rarr; <a href="https://github.com/cademirci/ghost-code">on Github</a>. <br><br> <div class="tools">Jekyll &emsp; HTML5 &emsp; CSS3 &emsp; SCSS/SASS &emsp; Javascript</div>'

Because I like to write JS and I thought jquery was very popular and as better way to use javascript as ten years ago. Indeed, jquery syntax is fun and short, and some of its functions -f.i. animate- seem like the best and easiest way to do something on a page. <br><br> However, jquery is an outdated library and it is odd to exist on a modern website now. Since then I have removed all jquery files in my working space and changed my mindset into create animations with CSS transitions. I went my way on with to write only native javascript also. <br><br> I used to write some jquery codes for some insignificant websites in the past. Now I can say that, if this library is necessary somewhere, or any supervisor wants me to write this, I am able to do it. On the other hand I do not prefer to do.'
