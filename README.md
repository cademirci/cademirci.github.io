# Personal Website

My name is Çağlayan Demirci and this is my personal website
which is including software I made, information about me and
some of my blog posts.

I designed and coded new version of my website, which is powered by Jekyll and hosted by GitHub, used no bootstrap, Jekyll-theme or any ready-to-use template.
Wrote CSS and Javascript a lot.

Ignore the absurd number of commits, they are the remains of times that I do not use localhost. Still some bugs always appear when update the website in spite of all
controls on the localhost. I have to add a couple of commits then.
